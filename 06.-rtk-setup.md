4. Enter information

(1) Enter either the IP or the URL of your caster connection.

(2) Touch Verify to make sure you can connect.

(3) Enter your Username and Password. Click the little eye to show the hidden characters. (If you're using rtk2go.com, enter a valid email address in username field or it won't work)

(4) Touch Get Source Table to bring up the list of mounts.

(5) Enter in the caster port it sends to. This is usually 2101.

(6) Touch the Position Tab

(7) Enter in your Fix position either manually fixed or provided by the GPS Fix position.

(8) Both send to Serial and UDP are on by default. Turn off the one you don't use. UDP port is normally 2233 for All In One Teensy board and most designs.

(9) Set how often in seconds the GGA data should be sent to caster. Set to 0 to turn off completely.

5. Touch OK.
6. Back to AgIO Main Display

7. There are many places to show you lots of information about RTK connection and data. On the far right side is a sentence grouper that works ok most of the time. If you require exacting information, use other software to analyze what is contained in the RTK stream. AgIO provides a simple guide.

### Serial Setup

1. Choose Serial NTRIP from the NTRIP Menu

2. Make sure Serial NTRIP is green. If turning it on, AgIO will reset.

3. Choose the com port that the RTK is coming in on. Set also the correct baud rate. Touch connect.
4. Decide how the RTK is getting to the GPS receiver - either by serial connection or by UDP. Also set the correct port if using UDP.
5. Touch OK.
