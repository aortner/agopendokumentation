1. Connect to any USB com port and see what is happening. Use 115200 Baud for Teensy and 38400 for Arduino.
2. If you touch the "Log" button - it will show you the incoming NMEA sentence data to AgIO.
3. You can save what was displayed to a log file zAgIO\_SerialMon\_log.txt saved in the main program folder.
4. Touch the Garbage can to delete the window contents.
5. Help. Brings up this page in the Wiki.
6. If the Ethernet Setup dialog is open, and the Serial Monitor, and you are connected to the Nano USB of the steer module, you will be able to see a few diagnostic items like IP and Subnet, ADS1115 count value, Current A/D Value, and the Switch Byte. It gets updated every 2 seconds as the Scan is sent to the module.
